// Array -->
// created in heap and stack

// we have to create new array for increasing or decreasing its size

// changes of perfect utlizing is less, as it would have some extra space left over or may not be sufficient to store all elements
// use where we are sure that no. of elements is fixed

// occupy space ewual to size of data\

// random access is possible

// Insertiion at start is O(n), as we have to move all elements, sot movement of data is costly
// and at last position it take O(1)
// same for deletiopn

// we can perform Linear and Binary search

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Linked List -->
// created in heap

// we can increase or decrease its size

// we don't have to think of its lengthj we can just create node according to our need

// occupy space ewual to size of data and also have pointer to next node, it occupy extra space

// random access is not possible

// Insertiion at start is O(1)
// and at last position it take O(n), as we have to traverse to end of linked list
// same for deletiopn
// we can perform Linear

// Insertion and Merge sort is designed for linked list
