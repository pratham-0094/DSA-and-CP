// Linear Linked list -->
// It takes less space compared to Doubly Linked List as there is only one pointer

// Insertion / Deletion at first position takes only O(1)
// one link is modified at insertion and zero links for deletion

// Insertion / Deletion at any other position is same for all the linked list O(n)
// two link is modified and one links for deletion

// if we have to access data and didn;t had to come back

// Circular Singly list -->
// It takes less space compared to Doubly Linked List as there is only one pointer

// Insertion / Deletion at first position takes only O(n) as last node again point to first so we have to traverse to the linked list
// two link is modified at insertion and one links for deletion

// Insertion / Deletion at any other position is same for all the linked list
// two link is modified and one links for deletion

// circular

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Linear Doubly Linked list -->
// It takes more space as there are two pointer

// Insertion / Deletion at first position takes only O(1)
// three link is modified and two links for deletion

// Insertion / Deletion at any other position is same for all the linked list
// three link is modified (for last node), otherwise four links and one links for deletion (for last node), otherwise two links
