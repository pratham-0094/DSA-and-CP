// Spanning Tree --> it is sub-graph of a graph having all its vertex mean "n - 1" edges
// such that no cycle was found and grapgh is connected
// gragh G(V,E), V = set of edges and E = set of edges between the vertex
// so spanning tree be G(V',E')  then V' = V and E' = n - 1
// a graph has multiple spanning tree
// no.of spanning tree = nCr - cycles, where e = E and r = V - 1

// weighted graph --> each edge has some weight or cost
// MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) --> spanning tree with minimun cost or weight
