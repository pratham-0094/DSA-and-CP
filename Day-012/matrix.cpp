// special matrices are square matrices that dimension is n*n
// they have more number of zero element
// we have to avoid storage of zero element and only store non-zero element, so that storage can be saved as well as computation time

// Types of matrix :-
// diagonal matrix
// lower trangle matrix
// upper trangle matrix
// symmetric matrix
// tridiagonal matrix
// bound matrix
// toeplitz matrix
// sparse matrix
