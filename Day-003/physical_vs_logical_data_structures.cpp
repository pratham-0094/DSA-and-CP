// physical data structures
// array
// linked list

// logical data structures
// stack - linear (LIFO)
// queue - linear (FIFO)
// tree - non-linear
// graph - non-linear
// hash table - tabular

// array and linked list are physical data, structure they called physical data structure as it decides or define how the memory is organised/allocated
// array - collection of contigious memory location, all thse location are side by side, they are at one plce
// it is of fixed size, once it created it cannot be increased or decreased
// it is static
// it can created either in stack or in heap by using pointer that point to that memory at heap
// when we nw maximum number of data then we can use array

// linked list - this is a complete dynamic data structure
// where each node contain data and is linked to next node
// the length of lis can be grow or reduced, so it is having variable length
// it is always created in heap
// its size is not known

// physical data structure are actually meant for storing the data, they hold the data
// logical data structure are actually used in lagorithm and for implementing thes data structure we use array, linked list or combination of both
