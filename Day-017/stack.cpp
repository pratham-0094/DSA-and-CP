// stack is a datastructure that work on principle last-in first-out / first-in last-out ( LIFO / FILO )
// stack is a colection of element, set of values that is inserted or deleted in following this principle
// stack can be implemented using array / linked list

// we know that recursion uses stack and also we can convert recursion method into iterative method
// this sometime required use of stack

// ADT of stack - abstract datatype of stack
// that contain data representation and operations on stack

// data:
// we need space for storing the element
// top pointer that pointing to the topmost element

// operation:
// push(x) - adding value to the top of stack
// pop() - deleting topmost value
// peek(index) - looking at a value at given position
// stackTop() - to know what is the topmost value
// isEmpty() - return true if stack is empty
// isFull() - return true if stack is full

// application of stack :-
// parenthesis matching
