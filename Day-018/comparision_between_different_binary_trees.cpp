// 1. Full binary tree
// binary tree of height 'h' having maximum no.of nodes 'n'
// no. of nodes = 2 ^ (h + 1) -1, where h is height
//  it is complete binary tree

// 2. Complete binary tree
// if binary tree represented in array then there should not be any blank spaces in betweeen them
// nodes are filled from left to right

// 3. Strict binary tree
// also called as proper binary tree
// degree(0) or degree(2)
// on storing in array it have blank spaces between them

// In books, strict binary tree is also called as complete binary tree,
// and complete binary tree is called as almost complete binary tree
